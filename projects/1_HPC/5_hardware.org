|                               |      |
|                               |      |

* HPC hardware reset
| power button cannot power on/off    | disconnected physically inside the module | preventing mistakes |
| the power cable connected multiple  | nodes serially so do not plug out!!       |                     |
| if you want to power off some nodes | dessemble the module for more than 5sec   | and reassemble      |
|                                     |                                           |                     |
| module dessemble                    |                                           |                     |
| node + bmc makes a module           |                                           |                     |
| 1. loosen the volt with a hand      |                                           |                     |
| 2. pull the tip under the bmc side  |                                           |                     |
| 3. pull the module                  |                                           |                     |
| 4. wait 5sec                        |                                           |                     |
| 5. push the module again            |                                           |                     |
